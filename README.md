# ScannedDocumentSorter
An auto-filling database lookup tool to convert paper charts of patient (doctor notes, soap notes, etc) into electronically filed folders.

If you wish to use it, you have to have a patient database similar to the export of a Patient Demographic File from an EHR software such as Kareo. 

As such, populating the database is easy using the DBTools.py and cbd.py. To run, execute the ScannedDocumentSorter.py and it will prompt you as to how you would like to continue.

The options as as follows: 

1. You can input a first, last, or middle name (or a Date of Birth) to search by.
2. Run a SyncToy backup (if you have 2 drives you wish to clone for redundancy).
3. Quit the program
